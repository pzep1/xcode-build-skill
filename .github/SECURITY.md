# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you find any security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue.

Instead, please report it via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to the maintainers (if an email is listed in the profile of @pzep1).
2. **Private Disclosure**: If you have a way to contact the maintainer privately (e.g., via a connected platform), please do so.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for the fix.

## Supported Versions

Since this is a development tool/skill, we generally support the latest version of the main branch.

| Version | Supported          |
